### CCSDS
Founded in 1982 by the major space agencies of the world, the CCSDS is a multi-national forum for the development of communications and data systems standards for spaceflight.

Today, leading space communications experts from 27 nations collaborate in developing the most well-engineered space communications and data handling standards in the world.

The goal is to enhance governmental and commercial interoperability and cross-support, while also reducing risk, development time and project costs.
