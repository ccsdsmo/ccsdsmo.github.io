### What is the MO Browser?

The MO Browser enables you to quickly browse through the CCSDS MO Services definitions 
to access the operations, the operation signatures and data structures. It produces the 
same tables shown in the CCSDS standard books by parsing in real-time the XML definitions 
in the SANA registry.
