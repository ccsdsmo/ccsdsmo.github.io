### EGS-CC, ESA's European Ground Systems Common Core

The European Ground Systems â€“ Common Core (EGS-CC) is a European initiative to develop a common infrastructure to support space systems monitoring and control in pre- and post-launch phases for all mission types. This is expected to bring a number of benefits, such as the seamless transition from spacecraft Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT) to mission operations, reduce cost and risk, support the modernisation of legacy systems and promote the exchange of ancillary implementations across organizations.

The initiative is being performed as collaboration between ESA, European National Agencies and European Industry.

Used implementation: [To be confimed]

### ISIS, CNES' Initiative for Space Innovative Standards

Used implementation: Specific implementation

### NanoSat MO Framework

The NanoSat MO Framework (NMF) is a software framework for nanosatellites based on CCSDS Mission Operations services. It facilitates not only the monitoring and control of the nanosatellite software applications, but also the interaction with the nanosatellite platform. This is achieved by using the latest CCSDS standards for monitoring and control, and by exposing services for common peripherals among nanosatellite platforms. Furthermore, it is capable of managing the software on-board by exposing a set of services for software management.

In simple terms, it introduces the concept of apps in space that can be installed, and then simply started and stopped from ground. Apps can retrieve data from the nanosatellite platform through a set of well-defined Platform services. Additionally, it includes CCSDS standardized services for monitoring and control of apps. An NMF App can be easily developed, distributed, and deployed on a spacecraft.

Used implementation: Reference implementation for a software simulator with many similarities to OPS-SAT

On-going implementation: OPS-SAT mission (to be launched)
