### EGS-CC, ESA's European Ground Systems Common Core

The European Ground Systems â€“ Common Core (EGS-CC) is a European initiative to develop a common infrastructure to support space systems monitoring and control in pre- and post-launch phases for all mission types. This is expected to bring a number of benefits, such as the seamless transition from spacecraft Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT) to mission operations, reduce cost and risk, support the modernisation of legacy systems and promote the exchange of ancillary implementations across organizations.

The initiative is being performed as collaboration between ESA, European National Agencies and European Industry.
